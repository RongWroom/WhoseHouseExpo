## 1. Project Goal

Initialize a new Expo application for the "Whose House" project. The stack will use Expo Router for file-based navigation (similar to Next.js), Shadcn for UI components, and Supabase for the backend.

## 2. Core Scaffolding

Initialize the project using the "tabs" template to get Expo Router pre-configured.

```bash
npx create-expo-app WhoseHouse -t tabs
cd WhoseHouse
```
